                    A common argument against implementing accessibility features is that "it won't affect that many
                    people." However, according to the World Health Organization, about 16% of the global population
                    lives with a disability. Ensuring that digital content is accessible opens the content to a much
                    wider audience than if accessibility is ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, accessibility featurs improve the experience not just for those living with
                    disabilities, but everyone. For example, if you broke your arm, you may not be able to use a mouse
                    easily. If a website is designed with keyboard navigation, this is less of an issue for the user.
                    The website would otherwise be inaccessible to you during that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a user is in an environment where they cannot use their device's audio capabilities, captions on
                    a video would not only aid someone who is hard of hearing, but anyone in that situation. Captions
                    can also help users who are not fluent in the language being spoken, alloweing for deeper comprehension.
