                <p>
                    So, what really is accessibility when it comes to websites? Simply put, a website is accessible when
                    it can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. This includes
                    people
                    with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. An accessible website ensures that all users
                    can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the site effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the United States, the most widely followed guidlines for web accessibility comes from W3C, the
                    Web Accessibility Initiative. They have a set of guidelines called the Web Content Accessibility
                    Guidlines, or WCAG. WCAG provides four principles of accessibility:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Percievable</li>
                    <p>Website information must be presentable to users in a way that they can perceive. This means the
                        information must be visible, regardles off the user's ability. For example, a blind person
                        should be able to read the content with a screen reader.</p>
                    <li>Operable</li>
                    <p>User interface components must be operable. This means that all users must be able to utilize
                        the interface regardless of ability. For example, if a user has a motor disability, they may not
                        be able to use a mouse. The website should allow for keyboard navigation.</p>
                    <li>Understandable</li>
                    <p>Information presented on the website must be understandable. It should be clear and consice, and
                        user interactions should be expected.</p>
                    <li>Robust</li>
                    <p>Content should be parsable with a multitude of tools. This includes screen readers, keyboard-only
                        access, and no audio-only feedback.</p>
                </ol>
